## Motivations
* I wanted to prepare something close to a real-world working methodology. A set of reusable, standalone components such as buttons, inputs and modals etc. I've never done such a thing so it was an interesting and challenging task. 
## Project info
* Set of reusable components prepared in Storybook environment.
All of them have multiple available states and style options. Depending on usage the components could be adjusted accordingly. 
  * Forms allow for multiple input types with option to include custom validation. Providing a list of required inputs is enough to have a working form, including a loading animation.
  * Task lists support marking tasks as important, archiving, adding new ones and wiping the done list.
* Project is prepared with expandability in mind. New components or different types of existing components can be easily added.
* Graphical inspiration taken from browsing multiple projects on Figma
## How to run this project
```
git clone https://github.com/MagUbas/ui-kit-storybook

npm install

npm storybook
```
## If I had more time I would
* Add more components. 
* Create an example site that uses those elements.
* Add tests
